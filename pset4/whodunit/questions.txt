1.  <stdint.h> is a header that gives definitions for the different int widths.
2.  Using unit8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, or uint16_t in your program inidcates to other individuals
    specificity about the possible width of the ints.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2.
4.  The first two bytes must be "BM" in ASCII, 66 77 in decimal, or 0x42 0x4D in hex.
5.  bfSize is a 4 byte int giving the size of the file. biSize is a 4 byte int that details the
    size of the header struct.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the pixels stored in the file are stored from bottom to top with the bottom
    left pixel being the first.
7.  biBitCount indicates the number of bits that will represent a pixel (and thus the range of possible
    colors for a pixel).
8.  If there were insufficient stack space (I think), or the system did not have the appropriate read/write
    access, fopen could return NULL.
9.  The size arguement in either case is set to the size of the entire struct itself. Thefore, only on
    iteration needs to be run (after fread returns, it sets the 'seek' position to where it stopped).
10. copy.c assigns a value of 3 to padding.
11. fseek moves the FILE object position indicate to the byte specified through the combination of offset
    and whence arguments.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current byte position indicator of a FILE object.
