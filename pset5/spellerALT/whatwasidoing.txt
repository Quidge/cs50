- was in the process of implementing check() inside dictionary.c
    - stuck on the part where check is passed a const string, and i
    can't do shit with a const string. so i tried to duplicate the const
    parameter string, but you kinda(?) can't do that. that's what i'm
    stuck on.

- i was in the middle of building crawl() to traverse the damn tree because
    damnit i need to visually print out what the hell is in my tree. i'm thinking,
    1) finish that function
    2) guarentee that my dict tree is all there
    3) ^ determine if load/insert are working properly
    4) fix either them or check(), now that i know which it is
    5) jesus
